Implementation of assignment from GoHealth company (CLI app for tracking issues).
Assignment doc is placed in root folder of project (SWE_Home_Assignement_in_Java.docx).

Time spent: 4 hours +-

I used:
    JDK 21
    Maven
    Spring Boot
    Hibernate
    Liquibase
    PostgreSQL
    Lombok
    Mapstruct
    Junit
    Mockito

I implemented both SQL and CSV type storages. User can choose storage type in CLI.
I also prepared some test data (in liquibase changelog file for SQL and in storage.csv file for CSV).
CSV file (storage.csv) is located at root folder of the project.
